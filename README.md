Overview
This project implements a basic K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier from scratch, without using external libraries.

Features
Loads and preprocesses data from a CSV file.
Splits data into training and testing sets.
Calculates Euclidean distance between points.
Classifies test points based on K-nearest neighbors.
Evaluates model accuracy and confusion matrix.
Tests multiple values of K to find the optimal K for classification.

Usage
Load a CSV dataset with numerical features and a class label (last column).
Run the script to train and test the K-NN classifier.
The script outputs accuracy and confusion matrix for different K values.

Dependencies
No external libraries are needed (uses built-in Python modules only).

How to Run
Set the dataset path in the code and run it to see classification results.

Output
Accuracy for each K value and the optimal K with the highest accuracy.
